In this project, I examined engagement metrics from data provided by 365 Data Science, which includes the number of days students have spent on the platform, the minutes of watched content, and the number of courses theyâ€™ve started. Then from this data I trained several machine learning models, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, and random forests. The goal is to predict whether students would upgrade their free plan to a paid one.
